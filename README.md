#angus_tutorial


During #QuarentineLife. I set out to complete the ANGUS workshop hosted at UC Davis in 2019.
	All together the workshop was extremely helpful and can be found at: https://angus.readthedocs.io/en/2019/
	I learned a lot and highly recommend to other people trying to learn some basics in bioinformatics.
