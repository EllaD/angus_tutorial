Snakemake is a workflow engine based out of pythong. It easily scaleable and uses 'wildcards' to easily run the workflow through many files.

Python is the only requirement to run Snakefiles 
It optimizes the number of parellel processes and works on single machines and clusters
Supports user defined and multiple wildcards within rules

The Language 
	Based on Python language but can support bash and R as well
	Is really just a list of 'rules' that say 
		1.) Take this input file(s)
		2.) here is the output files to create
		3.)Do this thing in their shell, R, python
		
	General rule set up:
			rule name:
			   input: "data/{sample}.fastq.gz
			   output: "newfolder/{sample}_new.fastq.gz"
  				   "newfolder/{sample}_otheroutputfile.html"
			   shell:'''
				command -o newfolder{intput}
				'''
	where {sample} is a wild card
		multiple wildcards are supported

Snakemake will not execute rules if the output files are already created so no duplication in the workflow
